 <strong>Review:</strong> If you're into sad anime or looking for a cry, this anime is for you. Almost every episode is an emotional rollercoaster. Other than that,
 I<br> loved the art style and the concept of this story. It is definitely a must watch!
 </p>
 <p id="Cowboy">
 <img src="Images/Cowboybebop.jpg" width="70%" height="50%" title="Cowboy Bebop">
 <p>
 <strong> Cowboy Bebop </strong> consists of a team of bounty hunters in space! They try to search for wanted fugitives, but get into all kinds of trouble along the
 way. 
 <p> 
 <strong>Review:</strong> This is definitely a classic action anime! This is one of my first anime I ever watched and it will still be one of my favorites. 
</p>

<p id="Jujutsu">
 <img src="Images/JujutsuKai.jpg" width="70%" height="50%" title="Jujutsu Kaisen">
 <p><strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong> focuses on <em>Yuji Itadori,</em> who lives in a world filled with evil and sorcerers. He hears about a cursed talisman called the <em>finger of<br> Sukuna</em>, a demon and it’s being targeted by other cursed beings.
 Unfortunately, he comes across the finger and eats it in order to save his friends -<br> he ends up becoming the demon's host. He sets off on a journey to defeat this entity!
</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> One of the best modern anime I've ever watched. I love the story and how comedic it is! It really gets you hooked with the plot and<br> animation.
</p>
<p id="Maid">
 <img src="Images/MaidSama.jpg" width="70%" height="50%" title="Maid-Sama">
 
 <p><strong>Maid Sama</strong> centers upon a girl named <em>Misaki Ayuzawa</em>, who has to juggle her school reputation and maid job. She is the president of Seika High<br> School and tries to make the school a better place for girls.
 Lead male, <em>Takumi Usui</em>, takes an interest in her hard work and commitment. 
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>Review:</strong> I binge watch this show many times! Though I’m not into romance anime. I love the Ayuzawa and Usui dynamic so much and the show<br> is really funny. Also, I can relate to the main character in a way, which I like.
</p>
<p id="Haikyuu">
 <img src="Images/Haikyuu.jpg" width="70%" height="50%" title="Haikyuu!!">
 <p>
 <strong>Haikyuu!!</strong> is about a boy named <em>Hinata Shouyou</em>, who gained an interest in volleyball. He is quite determined to become a championship’s star<br> player, despite his height. He meets interesting people along the way and ultimately 
 creates strong bonds. 
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>Review:</strong> I really enjoyed this sports anime. A lot of my friends love it as well. The character developments and energy in this show were really<br> amazing! Not to mention being emotionally attached with the characters.
